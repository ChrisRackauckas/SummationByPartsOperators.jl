# Linear advection equation with constant coefficients

This tutorial is concerned with the basic linear advection equation

```math
\begin{aligned}
    \partial_t u(t,x) + \partial_x u(t,x) &= 0, && t \in (0,T), x \in (x_{min}, x_{max}), \\
    u(0,x) &= u_0(x), && x \in (x_{min}, x_{max}), \\
    u(t,x_{min}) &= u_L(t).
\end{aligned}
```

Note that the advection velocity is positive (unity). Thus, a boundary condition
needs to be specified exactly at the left boundary. Otherwise, the problem will
not be well-posed (under-specified or over-specified).

Let's create an appropriate discretization of this equation step by step. At first,
we load all packages that we will use for this example.

```@example linear_advection
using SummationByPartsOperators, OrdinaryDiffEq
using LaTeXStrings; using Plots: Plots, plot, plot!, savefig
```

Next, we specify the initial and boundary data as Julia functions as well as the
spatial domain and the time span.

```@example linear_advection
xmin, xmax = -1.0, 1.0
u0_func(x) = sinpi(x)
uL_func(t) = t >= 3 ? sinpi(t) : zero(t)
tspan = (0., 8.0)
```

This choice of the domain and boundary condition ensures that the initial profile
is transported out of the domain before non-homogeneous boundary data influences
the solution.

Next, we implement the semidiscretization using the interface of
[OrdinaryDiffEq.jl](https://github.com/SciML/OrdinaryDiffEq.jl)
which is part of [DifferentialEquations.jl](https://diffeq.sciml.ai/latest/).

```@example linear_advection
function rhs!(du, u, D, t)
  # Set `du = - D * u` using in-place multiplication avoiding allocations
  # for efficiency
  mul!(du, D, u, -one(eltype(D)))

  # Next, we impose the boundary conditions weakly using an SAT at the left
  # boundary. Since we use the strong form of the equation, we do not need to
  # do anything at the right boundary.
  # Assuming that boundary nodes are included in the grid, adding this SAT
  # can be achieved by
  du[begin] += (uL_func(t) - u[begin]) / left_boundary_weight(D)

  return nothing
end
```

Here, we have used a simultaneous approximation term (SAT) to impose the boundary
condition weakly. In general, this approach is related to the weak imposition
of boundary conditions using numerical fluxes in finite volume and discontinuous
Galerkin methods; they are even equivalent for the linear advection equation
considered here.

Next, we choose an SBP operator `D`, evaluate the initial data on the grid, and
set up the semidiscretization as an ODE problem.

```@example linear_advection
D = derivative_operator(MattssonNordstr√∂m2004(), derivative_order=1, accuracy_order=4,
                        xmin=xmin, xmax=xmax, N=101)
u0 = compute_coefficients(u0_func, D)
ode = ODEProblem(rhs!, u0, tspan, D);
```

Finally, we can solve the ODE using an explicit Runge-Kutta method with adaptive
time stepping.

```@example linear_advection
sol = solve(ode, Tsit5(), saveat=range(first(tspan), stop=last(tspan), length=200));

plot(xguide=L"x", yguide=L"u")
plot!(evaluate_coefficients(sol[1], D), label=L"u_0")
plot!(evaluate_coefficients(sol[end], D), label=L"u_\mathrm{numerical}")
savefig("example_linear_advection.png")
```

Let's create an animation of the numerical solution.

```@example linear_advection
using Printf; using Plots: Animation, frame, gif

let anim = Animation()
    idx = 1
    x, u = evaluate_coefficients(sol[idx], D)
    fig = plot(x, u, xguide=L"x", yguide=L"u", xlim=extrema(x), ylim=(-1.05, 1.05),
              label="", title=@sprintf("\$t = %6.2f \$", sol.t[idx]))
    for idx in 1:length(sol.t)
        fig[1] = x, sol.u[idx]
        plot!(title=@sprintf("\$t = %6.2f \$", sol.t[idx]))
        frame(anim)
    end
    gif(anim, "example_linear_advection.gif")
end
```
